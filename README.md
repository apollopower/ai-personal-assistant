# Alfred: The Artificially Intelligent, Personal Assistant

Alfred is a Personal Assistant AI who can speak to you.

## Getting Started

Alfred runs on a lightweight application, using Ruby and Sinatra on the server side.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the Sinatra Gem installed on your machine before being able to run Alfred.

You can do so by executing this command on your terminal:

```bash
gem install sinatra
```

### Running Alfred

Since Alfred is a Sinatra app, you will run it as Ruby program, like so:

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

This will get Alfred running on your local machine.

## Built With

- [API.AI](https://api.ai/)
- [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)

## Acknowledgments

Alfred was inspired after reading an article and tutorial by Patrick Catanzariti on [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-your-own-ai-assistant-using-api-ai/)

He was also based on the starting template of Patrick's own AI assistant, Barry.
